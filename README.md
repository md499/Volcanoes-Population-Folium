# Volcanoes-Population-Folium

This is a program that uses the built in python libraries- folium and pandas- to visualize volcanoes across the world by using the "volcanoes.txt" file. This program also analayzes population of countries
 
Map1.html: Has a base layer and map layer. There is also a layer control panel that helps the user see either volcanoes across the world, or population of countries. 
Map1.py: Contains the final code for the program. 

All updated changes will be stored in map1.html
The other .py programs(map_popup, map_advacned, etc) and .html files contain a step-by-step implementation of the this program with each version having a new feature. 

Volcanoes.txt: Contains data of volcanoes across the world - which are analyzed using pandas library in python
world.json: Contains country name, population - also analyzed using pandas library
